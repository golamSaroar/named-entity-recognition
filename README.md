## Named Entity Recognition using LSTMs

[Named Entity Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) models can be used to identify mentions of people, locations, organizations, etc. It is not only a standalone tool for information extraction, but also an invaluable preprocessing step for many downstream natural language processing applications like machine translation, question answering, and text summarization. 

In this project, I have built and trained a bidirectional LSTM neural network model to recognize named entities in text data.

Please have a look at the notebook [here](named-entity-recognition.ipynb), or open it on [Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GcLFRKgTyzpeAY3z1zwkac0an7FJ1jUG/view?usp=sharing).
